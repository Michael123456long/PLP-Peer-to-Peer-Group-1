This initiative has significantly enhanced my digital capabilities, preparing me for the dynamic demands of the digital economy. Through Ajira, I have developed a range of digital skills, including:

            E-Commerce: Understanding the intricacies of online business, from setting up e-commerce platforms to managing digital transactions.
            
            These experiences have not only broadened my technical skill set but have also improved my ability to adapt to various digital environments, making me well-prepared to contribute to modern, tech-driven workplaces.
